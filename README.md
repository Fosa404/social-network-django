## Social network made with django

I've created this little project since I hadn't worked with Django for a while. The application is deployed on Railway using a GitHub Actions workflow. This is the first time I've automated deployment with actions, and it was really fun to learn how to do it.

The application is a social network that implements a following system as well as the ability to create simple posts and update the profile picture. On the main page, you can see some examples of user posts that I've created, but if you want to try out more features of the application, you can create a user in **Signup**, and you'll notice that you can only see your posts and those of the users you follow.

By the way sorry for the styles, frontend is not my strong point but I ❤️ python `:smirk:`
